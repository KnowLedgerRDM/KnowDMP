# KnowDMP
Data management plans (DMPs) have recently become a hot topic for the research community because of funder requirements, and the movement toward digital science, and the long term archiving/provenance needed for ensuring access/reuse.  This repository is focused on the development and use of DMPs within the KnowLedger software, important for understand the rapidly evolving needs of the research community.  Of particular interest is the use of data from within the KnowLedger framework to create 'first draft' versions of a DMP based on how a researcher uses KnowLedger.
